## 💫 About Me:

👋 Hi, I'm Mohammed Hasan, a dedicated software tester with a passion for delivering top-notch quality solutions. 🚀

💡 With a strong background in manual and automated testing, I thrive on uncovering defects, ensuring software reliability, and enhancing user experiences. I specialize in using industry-standard tools like Selenium and Cypress to develop robust test frameworks and execute comprehensive test suites.

🌱 I constantly seek opportunities to learn and stay up-to-date with emerging trends in software testing. My goal is to leverage my expertise to contribute to the development of reliable, high-performing software applications.

🔬 In my testing journey, I have honed my skills in functional testing, regression testing, test case design, and defect management. I am experienced in creating test plans, executing test scenarios, and reporting accurate and actionable bug reports.

💻 Outside of work, I actively contribute to the testing community through my GitHub projects, where I share automation scripts, testing frameworks, and best practices. I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing to drive continuous improvement in the field of software testing.

📫 Let's connect! I'm always excited to network with like-minded professionals, collaborate on testing projects, and engage in meaningful discussions about software quality and testing strategies.
